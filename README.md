# bootstrap-portfolio

For this challenge I have created a portfolio page using the material I have learnt over the past few weeks.
I have implemented elements including HTML, CSS and Bootstrap to create a professional looking page with the requirements needed.

The page contains a NavBar which links to the relevant areas of the pafe as well as a hero section with information about myself.

My work section links to projects I have already compelted and in time I will add links to the remaining challenges (these currently have a blank href).

By using bootstrap I have reduced the use of media queries and I have added hover effects. 

This challenge has helped me to understand more about using bootstrap to create a webpage and how to customize bootstrap content.
